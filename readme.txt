== Changelog ==
= 0.8.2 =
Fix draft and private products appearing in front end search results when they match a SKU.
Fix a fatal error on PHP 8 when the search query is passed as an array (s[]=...).
Fix a trailing comma in the search (EG `WB-12,`) matching every product with a SKU.
Variations that are disabled no longer surface their parent product in front end search.
SKU matching escapes LIKE wildcards, so `_` and `%` in a search are matched literally.
Only the search clause is changed, so other query conditions such as category filters are left alone.
Declare compatibility with WooCommerce HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage).
Requires PHP 5.6, in line with the WooCommerce 3.0 minimum.
Tested with WordPress 7.1 and WooCommerce 11.1.

= 0.5.2 =
Bug fix release!
0.5.1 removed the plugin when searching in the Wordpress admin as Woocommerce has implemented searching for simple products by SKU.
I didn't realise they had not added searching for variable products by SKU. This release re-enables that feature, other new features:

* Fix long standing bug of the product filtering not playing nicely with the plugin. (Searching within categories etc)
* Handle multiple comma separated skus in search (Admin only)
* Admin search re-implemented to be much closer to Woocommerce search and make more appropriate use of Wordpress filters. (This will make it easier to *hopefully* integrate back into woocommerce core)
* General code tidy up.
= 0.5.1 =
* Disabling SKU search in admin to let Woocommerce handle it.
= 0.5 =
* Improved support for sites running [wpml](http://wpml.org/)
= 0.4 =
* Remove hidden products from search results
* "Total Found" search count works in more themes.
= 0.3 =
* Releasing to wordpress.org
